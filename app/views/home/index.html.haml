          The "Small Data Analyst" aims to implement an intelligent agent that provides advice based on statistical theory on the analysis of such data.
          The system depends on the design described in the related papers by
          %a(href="http://www.dcs.kcl.ac.uk/pg/isassoon/" target='_blank')
            Sassoon.

          The intelligence of this application is held in Statistical Knowledge Base that is applied on the provided datasets the user can upload.
          Context sensitive preferences allow to express preferences between multiple possible models to analyse which model should be the preferred one for this particular analysis, given the surrounding criterias.

        Key principles
      .panel-body
        The process of perfoming a general
        =link_to "Analysis", analyses_path
        envolves the following key steps:
        %ol
          %li
            Defining a
            =link_to "Research Question", research_questions_path
          %li
            Assigning suitable
            =link_to "Models", models_path
            to a Research Question and providing
            = link_to "Assumptions", assumptions_path
            that need to hold
          %li
            Defining (global)
            = link_to "Preferences", preferences_path
            to express a particular order between models in certain contextes that apply if an
            = link_to "Assumption", assumptions_path
            holds
          %li
            Uploading the
            = link_to "Dataset", datasets_path
            that has been aquired during a clinical study.
          %li
            Generation a new
            =link_to "Analysis", analyses_path
            and providing the answers required by the system to generate a list of possible models
          %li
            Answering further data related questions that might arise during the evaluation of the possible models to apply context domain specific preferences on the dataset.

        By applying these steps, clinicians will be able to make data-driven decisions that are based on the expertise entered by a statistician.
